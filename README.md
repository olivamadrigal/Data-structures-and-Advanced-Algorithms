# Data-structures-and-Advanced-Algorithms
This is a complete package with linear and non-linear data structures 
intended for a teaching enviroment, such as Advanced Data Structure Design and/or Advanced Algorithms Design.

DATA STRUCTURES USING ABSTRACT DATA TYPES with sample application data structures from advaced algorithms.

Library files explore the different implementations or fundamental data structures with concrete simulation examples, such as
databases, greedy algorithms, SSSP Dijkstra, a forest to build a minimum spanning tree (MST), and breadth first search.

Everything is in the C programming language as it ensures solid understanding of abstract data types,
memory understanding (heap and stack), string maniputation, and pointers. 

Examples can easily be mapped into object oriented programming languages, such as  C++ or Python quite naturally.

##################

FIRST PART: ARRAYS (FIXED AND DYNAMIC), LINKED LISTS, QUEUES, STACKS

SECOND PART: GRAPHS (matrix and linked list), BINARY HEAPs (array and pointer-based), HASHING TABLES (array, chaning, buckets) and differenr probing, BST, & SORTING (all fundamental sorting).

EXERCISES: GENERAL TREES, AVL, RED-BLACK TREE, B-TREES (aka M-way trees), sorting in linear time (radix etc.) and more specialized ones like merkle tres (hash trees), tries, etc.
