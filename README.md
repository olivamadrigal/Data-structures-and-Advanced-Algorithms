DATA STRUCTURES USING ABSTRACT DATA TYPES with sample application data structures

Library files explore the different implementations or fundamental data structures with concrete simulation examples, such as
databases, greedy algorithms, Dijkstra, a forest to build a minimum spanning tree, and breadth first search.

Everything is in the C programming language as it ensures solid understanding of abstract data types,
memory understanding (heap and stack), string maniputation, and pointers. 

Examples can easily be mapped into object oriented programming languages, such as  C++ or Python quite naturally.

##################
FIRST PART: ARRAYS (FIXED AND DYNAMIC), LINKED LISTS, QUEUES, STACKS
SECOND PART: GRAPHS (matrix and linked list), BINARY HEAPs (array and pointer-based), HASHING TABLES (array, chaning, buckets) and differenr probing, BST, & SORTING (all fundamental sorting).
EXERCISES: GENERAL TREES, AVL, RED-BLACK TREE, B-TREES (aka M-way trees), sorting in linear time (radix etc.)
MORE SPECIALIZED DATA STRUCTURES: MERKLE TREES (hash trees), TRIES, etc.
